ACTIVITY 1

Say words like “the solution SHOULD HAVE”
For example:
The system should be secure and robust:
•	System must validate all data inputs.
•	System must use secure cookies. 
•	System must use SHA256 Encryption for the passwords.


Introduction and business context
Discuss an overview of the current landscape of the relevant topic
Explain the market gap of this topic
Discuss the purpose of the rationale
Empathy map + user stories
Decomp of functional requirements
Talk about different relevant potential requirements and what they are going to be like.
Include a description of what user inputs may be required.
For example:
About page: the system displays a page that is is similar to the homepage and consists of the navigation bar, main section etc. No data inputs are required for this page.

For example:
•	Navigation bar

•	Booking system
Decomp of non-functional requirements
Talk about the following points. Use words like “should be”.  For example, “the webpage should be loaded within 2-4 seconds”
 - Scalability
 - Usability
 - Security
 - Performance/reliability


Key performance indicators
Talk about user engagement and other potential performance indicators relating to the topic: for example: 
Engagement KPIs:
•	tutor performance
•	student performance and progress
Business KPIs:
•	Trustpilot reviews
•	Visitor satisfaction rate
Website KPIs:
•	Page load time
•	Bounce rate
Proposal + Justification
Create a detailed outline of the programs core features focusing on relevant functions.
Highlight how the program can provide different relevant uses.
Discuss the target audience and how it can help them
Make sections to speak of how the recommended solution meets the needs of the client. For example:
•	Personalised user experience

Regulatory requirements include:
•	data privacy
•	accessibility
•	copyright laws
•	payment processing regulations
Conclusion (probably not needed, the justification and rationale is basically the conclusion)
Create a summary of the rationale about how the digital solution meets the needs of the users in a secure, accessible, scalable manner
Speak of future considerations, expanding on functions and features that can extend the program
